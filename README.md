# RoomKitServer

## Getting Started
After cloning this repo, navigate to the folder created using your prefered command line interface. Run the following command to install the virtual environment so that your global setup of python isn't effected.

```bash
sudo pip install virtualenv
```

Follow that by initializing your environment:

```bash
virtualenv venv
```

and activate it so we can get to installing packages and developing!

```bash
. venv/bin/activate
```

Now you can install all the required packages for this project:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You are all set up to run and test the RoomKit server! Enjoy!
